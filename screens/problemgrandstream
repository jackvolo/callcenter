<p>The grandstream is a small grey and black box. It should have 3 cables plugged into the back: power, phone, and internet. In the front there should be 4 green lights. From left to right those are: power, internet, link/act, and phone.</p>
<p>All lights should be either solid or blinking green. Please let me know which if any are not lighting up.</p>


<dl class="problemgrandstream">
<dt>Power is off/All are off</dt>
<dd>
<p>This indicates the device is not getting power. Can you confirm the connection on the power connector is solid and the plug goes into a working outlet?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Internet or Link/Act light is off</dt>
<dd>
<p>This indicates the device is not connected to the internet. Please confirm that the ethernet cable is snugly connected to both the grandstream and your router.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Phone light is off</dt>
<dd>
<p>This indicates the grandstream is not correctly communicating with our service. Unplug the power from the grandstream for 10 seconds and then plug it back in.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p class='dont-say'>If these steps don't fix the problem click on file ticket and tell the customer a technician will need to look into the problem further.</p>
