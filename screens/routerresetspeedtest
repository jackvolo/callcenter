title: Reset customer router
buttons: speedtest: Continue

<p>Sometimes to achieve full peformance routers need to be rebooted. Let's try that now.</p>

<p>Unplug the power cable. That's the small black cable in the back of the router with a round plug. Wait 10 seconds, then plug it back in.</p>

<p class="dontsay">The customer may need to leave the phone to be able to reach their router, so it's best to tell them the instructions all at once.</p>

<p>It will take 30 to 60 seconds for the router to reboot. Let me put you on hold for one minute while we wait for it to reboot.</p>
