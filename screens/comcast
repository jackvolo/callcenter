<p>If you see an Xfinity login that means you are connected to a Comcast/Xfinity modem. Those will not work Volo's service.</p>

<p>We provide our service through ethernet ports. They will look like phone jacks with the same shape and tabbed style connector but are a little bigger. You can connect a computer directly to the port or use a router, but not a router/modem combo.</p>

<p>If you want to come to our office, we sell routers for $75 or we can come install it for $125. You are free to use any brand router bought from any store, and there are cheaper options available.</p>
<p class="dont-say">Our address 822 Pioneer St, Champaign IL. Hours are 9-6 Mon-Fri</p>
