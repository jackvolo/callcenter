<p>Volo has partnered with Town and Country to offer internet service to all residents. You can start using it immediately by connecting your computer or router to the ethernet port in your apartment. Do not use a modem, our service is incompatible with modems and modem/router combo devices.  If you want to add multiple computers or wifi you will want to install a router that is not a router/modem combo, which you can buy at Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, or other places.</p>

<p>The provided service is 3mbps, you may also upgrade to 100Mbps for 29.95 per month. Please call the Town and Country office at (217) 866-1755 to if you would like to upgrade to the 100Mpbs service, or navigate to volo.net/tnc.</p>
