<p>Volo Broadband this is _____, how can I help you?</p>

<p class="dont-say">Not everyone we serve has an account or customer number. Just continue and fill their information in manually</p>

<p class="dont-say">If the person says they just moved into an apartment and needs instructions or needs to set up an account, use "Potential Customer"</p>

<p class="dont-say">217-367-8656 is the Volo Office number. If that comes up as the caller ID, you have to ask the customer for their phone number and use that.</p>
