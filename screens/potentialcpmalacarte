<h4>608 E CHALMERS ONLY:</h4>
<p>We have a building wide wifi system here. Connet to the network labeled "CMI Broadband" and use the password "go illini go".<p>

<h4>END OF 608 E CHALMERS SECTION</h4>

<p>At that CPM apartment we offer speeds up to 1000mb/s (or gigabit) using advanced fiber optic.</p>

<p>A few buildings are limited to 100Mbps due to internal wiring. Right now this is <b>1010 W Stoughton St</b> </p>

<p>We offer month-to-month pricing starting at $19.95. There is no installation cost because no installation needs to be done. There is an ethernet port in the unit you can plug into and start using immediately.</p>

<p>As a special offer to certain apartments (including yours), we also have an Aparment 10 tier. This has the same target usage amount as the Light tier, but runs at 10mbps. So it's the only tier that doesn't get the full speed. It costs 19.95.</p>
