<p>Parkland Cover offers complimentary Volo internet service.</p>

<p>You don't have to sign up or pay anything extra. To start using your service, just plug an ethernet cable into the jack in your apartment and connect to either your computer or router.</p>

<p>If your address is 1302 Mariner, 3701 Harbor Estates, or 1202 Myrtle Beach, we may need to install the ethernet jack. The construction company made a mistake and put phone jacks in instead. If you don't have an ethernet jack we'll schedule a time to install that.</p>
