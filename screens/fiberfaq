<p>Our fiber optic internet service runs at 1000 mbps which makes it the among the fastest in the country. Pricing starts at 29.95 per month for the light tier, and all of our users get the full 1000 mbps. By separating our services into usage tiers we can deliver a super fast connection to all our customers.</p>

<dt class="fiberfaq" question='router'>Can I use my own router?</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd class="fiberfaq">
<p>You are free to use your own router. However, most low end or older routers will not be able
to keep up with Volo's blazing fast gigabit speed.</p>
<p>We don't recommend any specific brands, but you want to look for routers rated for gigabit speed on the WAN or internet port, and the LAN or local network ports.</p>
<p>You can also check www.smallnetbuilder.com--a site that tests routers to see they're as fast as advertised.</p>
</dd> <!--}}}-->
<dt class="fiberfaq" question='tiers'>What is the difference between the service tiers?</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd class="fiberfaq">
<p>The difference between the service tiers is how much usage they are designed for. None of the tiers will throttle your speed, cut you off, or charge you for overages, but each tier has a target usage amount. If you exceed that amount more than 3 times in a month, we will ask you to upgrade to an appropriate tier.</p>
<p>We usually describe our tiers in terms of video streaming because it is the biggest user of bandwidth on the internet.</p>
<p>Light is plenty for everyday usage and one or two Netflix (or other streaming) movies per day or an equivalent amount of usage.</p>
<p>Medium is for customers who want to watch up to 12 hours of Netflix (streaming) per day or equivalent amount of usage.</p>
<p>Heavy is for customers who use more than that.</p>
<p class='dont-say'>You may need to remind the potential customer that watching a steam on two different devices at the same time counts double (or triple with 3, etc)</p>
</dd> <!--}}}-->
<dt class="fiberfaq" question='whytiers'>Why do you have usage based tiers instead of speed based?</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd class="fiberfaq">
<p>Our costs are based on how much total bandwidth you use, not how fast you use it. By separating our tiers into usage levels we can deliver our fastest service to all customers whether they use it a lot or a little.</p>
<p>By doing this we are able to offer our high tier for only &#36;60 compared to over &#36;100 with some of our competitors, and we can offer 1000 mbps to our light users.</p>
</dd> <!--}}}-->
<dt class="fiberfaq" question='overage'>What happens if I go over my tier?</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd class="fiberfaq">
<p>We will not throttle your speed, cut you off, or charge you for overages. Each tier has a target usage amount, and if you exceed the amount more than 3 times in a month, we will ask you to upgrade to an appropriate tier.</p>
</dd> <!--}}}-->
<dt class="fiberfaq" question='install'>Installation Cost</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd class="fiberfaq">
<p>Installation cost for a new install is typically &#36;150. That can be waived if you sign up 
for TV service or sign a 1 year contract for our Heavy Service.</p>
<p>We also offer a 30 day guarantee. If you're not happy with your service, and 
cancel in the first 30 days, we'll refund your installation fee.</p>
<p>Some apartments are pre-installed and there is no install fee.</p>
</dd> <!--}}}-->
<dt class="fiberfaq" question='price'>How much does Fiber cost?</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd class="fiberfaq">
<p>You can get lightning fast gigabit internet for as little as 29.95 per 
month!</p>
<p class="dont-say">The following table lists all the monthly fees. Add the line free, plus up to one from each section. Except "other services", you can add both of those.</p>

<dt class="fiberfaq" question='investment'>I want Fiber asap, what can I do?</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd class="fiberfaq">
<p>We have an investment club. With a contribution of of &#36;10,000 we will start the permitting process immediately and construction can begin 60-90 days after that. If you'd like to pursue that, I can have somebody call you back.</p>
