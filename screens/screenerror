title: Error in Volo script
buttons: calltech

<p class="dont-say">The call script got a bad reply from Volo, so
we can't move forward from here. You can click "<a href="#" class="foo">go back</a>" and try again.
if that doesn't work, please reload the page and start the script over.
Finally, call Thomas, Tony or Peter and let them know it's not working.
</p>

<script type="text/javascript">$(function() { $('a.foo').click(function() { $('div.screen:last-child a.back').click(); return false; }) });</script>
