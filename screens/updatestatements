>>TODO>> Implement v_command to query current billing preference - noted as %BILLING (probably update to %MESSAGE?)
>>TODO>> Probaby also auto-fill their email, if robot has not done so already

<p>I can certainly help out with updating your statement delivery method. I'm showing you are currently set to %BILLING.</p>

<p>Please note: effective June 16th, 2019, paper statements and invoices will have a $1.50 paper billing fee applied each billing cycle.</p>

<p>How would you like your bills delivered?</p>

<p class="dont-say">Also confirm email address is accurate, especially when changing to email statements/invoices.</p>
