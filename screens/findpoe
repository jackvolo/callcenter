title: Find the Volo termination box
buttons: voloreset: Yes, nopoeprobticket: No

<p>Let's try resetting the equipment and see if that restores your service.</p>

<p>You're looking for a small black or white box.  If it's black, it'll be about the size of your thumb and it'll say "DC  POE  LAN" on it.  If it's white or off-white it'll be about the size of a bar of soap, and it may say "CAT-5" on it.  Can you find that box?</p>
