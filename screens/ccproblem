<p>We have several experts on staff that can certainly look into resolving your problem. </p>

<p>Are you needing immediate help with the problem you're experiencing? I can try to get you in touch with a technician immediately, though there is a $100 upcharge for immediate service. </p>

<p>Alternatively, we'd be happy to take a look at it either in our office, or we can schedule a tech to either visit your address or to assist remotely. Our in-store and on-site support is $60/hour, and there's a flat $30 upcharge for an on-site visit for either troubleshooting or pickup and delivery.</p>
