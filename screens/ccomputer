<p>Our technicians would be happy to take a look at your device.</p>

<p>Our office is located at 3310 N Cunningham Ave, Urbana IL 61802, north on 45 from Urbana, at the intersection of Cunningham and Oaks Road.</p>

<p>Our technicians might be out at other tech visits at the time you drop it off, but they'll take a look at your computer as soon as they are available. In store support is $60/hour, and many repairs may only take one hour to fix; however, our technicians should be able to give you an estimate on how long it might take if it goes beyond that initial hour, and will contact you if repairs are more extensive than such.</p>

<p>Let me take down some information regarding the problem you're experiencing so our technicians can have an idea of how best to assist you.</p>
