<p>At your location, we offer superfast internet starting at &#36;19.95. There are no installation or setup fees.</p>

<p>You should find an ethernet port in the unit you can plug into and you can sign up through the capture portal or I can sign you up over the phone.</p>

<p>We offer 4 tiers of service at your location. Light, Medium, Heavy all run at 1000Mbps (or Gigabit) and are differentiated based on how much you use the service. As a special offer to certain apartments (including yours), we also have an Aparment 10 tier. This has the same target usage amount as the Light tier, but runs at 10Mbps not the full gigabit speed the rest do.</p>

<p>FOR A LIMITED TIME: if you sign up for service before August 15, the first month is free.</p>

  <dl class="alacartefaq">
    <dt>What does an ethernet port look like?</dt>
    <dd>It's like a phone port except larger</dd>
    <dt>Does your service need a modem?</dt>
    <dd>No our service doesn't use modems. There should be an ethernet port you can plug into directly.</dd>
    <dt>Can I use a router with your service?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, our service is compatible with routers. It should work with any router you have.</dd>
    <dt>Does Volo sell routers?</dt>
    <dd>Yes. Volo sells routers for $50, if you want the wireless configured for your devices, it's $85</dd>

    <dt question='tiers'>What is the difference between the service tiers?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The difference between the service tiers is how much usage they are designed for. None of the tiers will throttle your speed, cut you off, or charge you for overages, but each tier has a target usage amount. If you exceed the amount more than 3 times in a month, we will ask you to upgrade to an appropriate tier.</p>
    <p>We usually describe our tiers in terms of video streaming because it is the biggest user of bandwidth on the internet.</p>
    <p>Light is plenty for everyday usage and one or two Netflix (or other streaming) movies per day or an equivalent amount of usage.</p>
    <p>Medium is for customers who want to watch up to 12 hours of Netflix (streaming) per day or equivalent amount of usage.</p>
    <p>Heavy is for customers who use more than that.</p>
    <p class='dont-say'>You may need to remind the potential customer that watching a steam on two different devices at the same time counts double (or triple with 3, etc)</p>
    </dd>
    <dt question='whytiers'>Why do you have usage based tiers instead of speed based?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Our costs are based on how much total bandwidth you use, not how fast you use it. By separating our tiers into usage levels we can deliver our fastest service to all customers whether they use it a lot or a little.</p>
    <p>By doing this we are able to offer our high tier for only &#36;60 compared to over &#36;100 with some of our competitors, and we can offer 1000 mbps to our light users.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt question='overage'>What happens if I go over my tier?</dt>
    <dd>
    We will not throttle your speed, cut you off, or charge you for overages. Each tier has a target usage amount, and if you exceed the amount more than 3 times in a month, we will ask you to upgrade to an appropriate tier.
