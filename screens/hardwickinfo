<p>Hardwick is providing Volo's gigabit fiber internet service to your unit.</p>

<h4>For 401 E University:</h4>
<p>You can start using it immediately by connecting your computer or router to the ethernet port in your apartment with a label. The label will be a letter followed a number 1 - 24. There will be 3 ports in your apartment, unfortunately the electrician did not wire the building correctly so we have a work around. You are meant to have 2 working ports but there is only one cable run. To work around this we have installed a 3rd port next to the live port which is connected to the port in the other room. If you wish to use only the port in the other room, connect the provided cable between the two ports and plug your computer or router into the last port. If you wish to use both ports you will need a router or switch. With a router plug the internet/WAN/modem port into the live port (again the one with the label) and plug the provided cable from a local port into the other port on the wall. With a switch simply plug both wall ports into any ports on the switch.</p>
