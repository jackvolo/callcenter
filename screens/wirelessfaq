<p>Our Wireless service connects you to the Internet through a receiver we install on the roof of your building: Volo has two wireless Internet service choices available.</p>

<p>You still need a router to use WiFi, it's called wireless because that's how it's delievered to the location.</p>

<p>Our basic service starts at &#36;39.95 per month, and our streaming service costs &#36;75 per month.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Broadband</strong> is ideal for someone looking for basic high-speed Internet service.  This service works like the cell phone service where you have a limit each day, except if you exceed your limit your service slows down instead of incurring additional charges. It includes 250 Mega Bytes per day of Priority Bandwidth delivered over the trademark Volo connection. Basic Broadband includes, in our experience, ample bandwidth to browse the Internet and check your email. Other usage (particularly, streaming video like Netflix) can use that bandwidth up quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Streaming</strong> service is designed for users who enjoy watching Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, other video streaming sites, or listening to online radio for more than four hours per day. This service is not available in all locations. Streaming service doesn't permit peer-to-peer file sharing and do contain a data cap to prevent runaway processes like virus infections, but that cap will be tailored to your needs and even by default is ample for most streaming media uses (about 10GB/day).

<dl class="wirelessfaq">
<dt question='1'>How much does Volo Wireless cost?</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>The basic rate is &#36;39.95/month. That covers 250 MB/day of usage. You can add additional bandwith in increments of 250/day at &#36;10/month.</p>
<p>The streaming price is &#36;75 per month.</p>
<p>There is also an installation fee of &#36;300 depending on location. The installation fee can be paid over the first 3 months of service.</p>
<p>If you sign up for a qualifying DirectTV or Dish Network service through us, we will reduce the installation by &#36;150.</p>
</dd><!--}}}-->
<dt question='2'>What's the difference between megabits and megabytes?</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>One megabyte is equal to eight megabits, but the terms are used in specific ways: Mega<strong>bits</strong> per second (mbps) are generally used to describe the <strong>speed</strong> of an Internet connection, whereas mega<strong>bytes</strong> (MB) usually refer to the <strong>size</strong> of a file or storage space.</p>
<p>In practical terms, one megabit per second is slow but usable broadband Internet. Five to ten web pages, one minute of music, or a half a minute of video is about one megabyte of data.</p>
</dd><!--}}}-->
<dt question='3'>How the Service works</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>Our Wireless service connects you to the Internet through a receiver we install on the roof of your building: The receiver hooks into our wireless network in town. We run a cable from that receiver to an appropriate place on the outside of your house, near where your computer or network hub is located. The cable enters your house there, and plugs into a small black box that provides electrical power for the receiver.</p>
</dd><!--}}}-->
<dt question='4'>Coverage - Do you serve [location]?</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>We provide service to most locations within about 7 miles of downtown Champaign. If you'd like, I can have a technician call you back shortly to discuss details of our coverage in your area.</p>
<p>We do not cover Mahomet, St Joe, Tolono Pesotum, Rantoul, Monticello or White Heath.</p>
</dd><!--}}}-->
<dt question='5'>Do I own the equipment?</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>For security reasons, we can't sell the equipment to you. Beyond security reasons, the equipment is designed to work with our system, and wouldn't be much use outside of our network.</p>
</dd><!--}}}-->
<dt question='6'>What does the Volo receiver look like / How big is your antenna?</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>Customers in strong coverage areas use a receiver that's 12 inches square, either white or a medium gray.</p>
<p>Some customers require a larger antenna, a 36-inch wide wire grid. Usually the larger antenna would be in addition to the smaller one.</p>
</dd><!--}}}-->
<dt question='7'>What do I get for my Installation?</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>Your installation cost pays for a professional installation of the receiver, running cabling, mounting hardware, and setting up your computer or router. It also covers maintenance of the Volo equipment at your location for as long as you are a customer.</p>
</dd><!--}}}-->
<dt question='8'>If I move, do I pay for installation again?</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>If you move to an area that Volo serves, we will transfer your service to your new location for a nominal fee.</p>
</dd><!--}}}-->
<dt question='9'>How fast is Volo's wireless service</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>Volo Wireless speeds vary based on location. Customers can see download speeds between 2 to 20 megabits per second. There are many factors that affect speed so we cannot promise anything specific but I can file a ticket and have a technician attempt to provide a more precise estimate if needed.</p>
<p>For a sense of what this means, Netflix requires a 3mbps connection for DVD quality streaming.</p>
</dd><!--}}}-->
<dt question='10'>I have Unlimited Service, how can I go over a bandwidth allocation?</dt><!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>On our unlimited streaming connections we still set a technical bandwidth limit. This is intended to catch problems such as viruses on our customer's computers. Sudden increases in bandwidth usage are often a sign that a computer has been comprimised.</p>
<p>If you are hitting the limit with regular usage, we will raise the technical limit to a level where it does not interfere with your enjoyment of the internet.</p>
