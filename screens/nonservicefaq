<p>It doesn't look like he have services presently available at your location at this time. That said, I'd be happy to take down your information, and as our coverage area expands, we can reach out and let you know when service does become available.</p>

<dt question='bulk'>Can I get a quote for service for multiple apartments in my building?</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>If you're a property manager looking for an Internet Service Provider for an apartment building or complex, we'd be happy to discuss more tailored options rather than individual services. However, that much is handled by a different department. However, I can take down your contact info and they can return your call within the next business day or so.</p>
</dd> <!--}}}-->
<dt question='prospect'>Can I get any services with you at present?</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>Yes and no. We do offer Voice over Internet Protocol phone services, though this does require an active internet connection. At present, no internet services are available from us at your location. While our phones would work with another Internet Service Provider's internet, we would prefer to have both services with us to we can effectively troubleshoot if it's a phone problem or if the internet might be an issue.</p>
</dd> <!--}}}-->
<dt question='customfiber'>It looks like I'm in the light blue fiber region... but I can't get service?</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>The light blue region on our coverage map covers where we have fiber infrastructure ran, but the infrastructure is not yet ready for individual installations. Installations are technically possible, although the install cost can range from a couple to several thousand dollars, rather than the typical fiber installation of around $150. If this is something you're interested in however, let us know and one of our technicians can reach out to you with a more specific quote.</p>
</dd> <!--}}}-->
<dt question='prospectlist'>Do you do anything with my personal data?</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>Absolutely not. All of your data remains in-house, and only for reference so we may reach out when our internet service does become available. We do not sell or distribute any information of what we hope to be potential customers to other companies.</p>
</dd> <!--}}}-->
<dt question='futureservices'>Can you tell me a bit about your services as they become available?</dt> <!--{{{-->
<dd>
<p>Most likely, the service that will become available at your location will be our fiber services, which we have a few different options starting at just &#36;29.95/month. Depending on your location, there may be an installation charge associated with getting the service, but for the superfast speeds up to 1000mbps at that low monthly cost, it'd definitely be worth it!</p>
