<p>We can certainly schedule for a technician to look into your issue.</p>

<p>If the problem is strictly a software issue (for example, if your email client is acting up or you need help getting a program installed), we may be able to assist you remotely from our office. Our remote service actually only costs $1/minute with no minimum charge. This would also waive the on-site visit fee.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if this may be a hardware based problem, a tech visit may be necessary to resolve your issues.</p>

<p>Let me take down some information. What address are you located at? </p>

<p>What problems are you experiencing?</p> 

<p>If the situation may be resolved remotely, our technicians will follow up to let you know to expect a call from them at the scheduled timeframe.</p>
