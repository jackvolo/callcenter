<p>At Bailey Apartments, we offer superfast fiber internet. The pricing starts at &#36;19.95 per month. There are no installation or setup fees.</p>

<p>You should find an ethernet port in your unit you can plug into.  Once plugged in, our system will usually direct you to a web page that will allow you to sign up and choose a package.  If that doesn't work, I can also sign you up over the phone.</p>

<p>We offer 4 tiers of service at your location: Apartment10, Light, Medium and Heavy service.  Light, Medium and Heavy service all run at up to 1000Mbps (one Gigabit) and are differentiated based on how much you use the service, which I can go over with you in a few moments.</p>

<p>As a special offer to certain apartments, including yours, we also offer a budget-friendly lower-speed service called Aparment 10. This has the same target usage amount as the Light service, but runs at 10Mbps instead of the full gigabit speed of the other services. Because of that, Apartment 10 service is adequate for typical web surfing and email use, but won't work well for you if you watch much online video.</p>

<p>Light service costs $29.95 per month.  Medium service costs $49.95 per month.  Heavy service costs $59.95 per month.Apartment 10 service costs $19.95 per month. You can also prepay for a year for Medium or Heavy service and get 2 months free, which makes the Heavy service cost what Medium normally would cost.</p>

<p>Due to internal wiring at 111 S Lincoln Ave and 911 W Springfield Ave, those buildings are limited to 100Mbps. All other Bailey buildings have 1000Mbps available.</p>
