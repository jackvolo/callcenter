<p>Let me take down some information, and we'll run some automatic tests.</p>

<p>Is the problem the service is not working at all, it's running slowly, or do you see an Xfinity login screen?</p>

<p>Do you have a router?</p>

<p>Is the problem affecting more than one computer or device (phone, tablet, smart tv, etc)?</p>
