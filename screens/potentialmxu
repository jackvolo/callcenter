<p>Good news, Volo's service is already installed to your building. I just need to get some information to sign you up.</p>

<p>We offer month-to-month pricing starting at $19.95. There is no installation cost because no installation needs to be done. There is an ethernet port in the unit you can plug into and start using as soon as your account is activated.</p>

<dt>Service FAQs</dt>
<dd>
<dt>What does an ethernet port look like?</dt>
<dd>It's like a phone port except larger.</dd>
<dt>Does your service need a modem?</dt>
<dd>No our service doesn't use modems. There should be an ethernet port you can plug into directly.</dd>
<dt>Can I use a router with your service?</dt>
<dd>Yes, our service is compatible with routers. It should work with any router you have. However, better routers will deliver faster speeds. We recommend getting a router rated for gigabit speeds and with the AC WiFi designation.</dd>

<dd>Yes. Volo sells routers for $50, if you want the wireless configured for your devices, it's $85</dd>
