title: Forward to technician
buttons: routingticket: No one answered, conclude

<p>The test shows a configuration problem. Please hold while I contact a technician.</p>

<p class="dont-say">Please send the following message to chat: "There is a routing problem for customer <span class="username">_</span> at <span class="serviceaddress">_</span>. Is anyone available to work on this." Wait 60 seconds and if there's no reply let the customer know you will file a ticket to have a technician work on the problem and click "No one answered".</p>
