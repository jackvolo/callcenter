<p>As the installation is constructing a new utility from our infrastructure up to your location, we do set installations at least a week out in order to schedule the requisite JULIE among other preparations. We aim to complete the installation and bring the service live that day; however, as this is a new construction, we cannot guarantee completion as complications may arise where we will need to return to complete it at a later date; if such occurs, our technicians will keep you appraised of the situation. We would strongly recommend to not cancel any existing service until the technicians confirm that the installation is complete and service is live, however. </p>

<p>In the construction, we do bury our fiber optic cable in your yard.

(If November - March:) In winter especially when the ground is frozen, we may require returning in the spring to bury your fiber optic cable. We will endeavor to drape the fiber through your yard where it is least likely to be damaged until we can bury it.

At the time of burial, depending on the ground condition, there will be some minor disruption from the trenching may be some disruption from the machinery. We will make efforts to restore your yard after upon completion of installation, though if additional restoration is needed after two weeks then feel free to contact our office to arrange for a technician to survey the situaion.</p>

<p>Though our month-to-month services do not have a term-contract, we do have a Standard Service Agreement which outlines the terms and conditions of our service. We would love to forward you a copy for your records, although our technicians should also have a paper copy for you to sign at the time of installation. What email address should we send a copy to?</p>
