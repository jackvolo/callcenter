<p>In your area we offer Volo's Superfast Fiber service. This is the fastest residential internet service available in the nation.</p>
<p>Volo has built a brand new state of the art fiber optic network.</p>
<p>Other companies offer services with typical speeds in the 8 to 20 megabit 
range. Volo's Fiber service will be 1000 megabits (also known as 
gigabit).</p>
<p>So, would you like to pay less money for faster service?</p>
<p class='dont-say'>This part is optional</p>
<p>Other companies offer no guaranteed minimum speed--this translates to 
increased time waiting while pages load, no guarantee that your phone will 
work or that Netflix will stream at full quality. Volo's services offers 
guaranteed minimum bandwidth from 1mbps (appropriate for voice) and up.</p>
