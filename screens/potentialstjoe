<p>We are excited about expanding to the St Joseph area and look forward to having you as a customer. We are entering the area in phases, beginning with the North side of town. From there we will continue our build out and hope to have service to the entire town in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>

<p>If you like, I can explain our services to you now, or we can call you back when we're ready to install your area and go over everything.</p>

<br />

<p class="dont-say">Only read the following if the caller wants. Otherwise just fill out their information and file a ticket.</p>
